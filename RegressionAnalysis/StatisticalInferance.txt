Statistical inference requires navigating the set of assumptions and tools and subsequently thinking about how to draw conclusions from data.

The tools of the trade
Randomization: concerned with balancing unobserved variables that may confound inferences of interest.
Random sampling: concerned with obtaining data that is representative of the population of interest.
Sampling models: concerned with creating a model for the sampling process, the most common is so called “iid”.
Hypothesis testing: concerned with decision making in the presence of uncertainty.
Confidence intervals: concerned with quantifying uncertainty in estimation.
Probability models: a formal connection between the data and a population of interest. Often probability models are assumed or are approximated.
Study design: the process of designing an experiment to minimize biases and variability.
Nonparametric bootstrapping: the process of using the data to, with minimal probability model assumptions, create inferences.
Permutation, randomization and exchangeability testing: the process of using data permutations to perform inferences.
