Try mentioning someone in a comment to get the conversation going: The project consists of two parts (i) a simulation exercise and (ii) a basic inferential data analysis, the former is presented here. Asymptotics form the basis for frequency interpretation of probabilities, where the behavior of statistics depends on the sample size or some other relevant quantity of limits to infinity or to zero, and are the the \" swiss army knives of statistics,\" Brian Caffo. #Simulations were made to investigate the asymptotic distributions of exponential distributions, a discreet case, and compared to test statistics which are expected to be Gaussian, a strong form of the #CentralLimitTheorem, in #R4.0. Results show that like with greater n n in the CLT, or with an increase the unit of time, λ, the coverage improves and adheres to the CLT. https://lnkd.in/evh-8PV R4.0 Environmental Settings library(knitr) - creating the document library(ggplot2) - making plots key words: Asymptotics, The Central Limit Theorem, Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean, Sample Variance, versus Theoretical Variance, Distributions.","attributesV2":[]},"trackingId":"EMunzhuUT2uWksvF9UmdJg==","read":true,"publishedAt":1609400685787,"contentAccessibilityText":"Related content: ","$recipeTypes":["com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.identity.notifications.FullCard"],"$type":"com.linkedin.voyager.dash.identity.notifications.Card","contentSecondaryText":[],"additionalContentImagesCount":0,"cardAction":{"reloadCard":false,"actionTarget":"/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6749953282506076160","type":"DISPLAY","$recipeTypes":["com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.identity.notifications.FullCardAction"],"primary":false,"$type":"com.linkedin.voyager.dash.identity.notifications.CardAction"},"settingOptions":[{"settingOptionDetails":null,"notificationTypeUrn":null,"edgeSettingUrn":null,"description":{"textDirection":"FIRST_STRONG","text":"Delete this notification","attributesV2":[],"$recipeTypes":["com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.common.text.TextViewModelV2"],"$type":"com.linkedin.voyager.dash.common.text.TextViewModel"},"title":{"textDirection":"FIRST_STRONG","text":"Delete","attributesV2":[],"$recipeTypes":["com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.common.text.TextViewModelV2"],"$type":"com.linkedin.voyager.dash.common.text.TextViewModel"},"$recipeTypes":["com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.identity.notifications.FullSettingOption"],"$type":"com.linkedin.voyager.dash.identity.notifications.setting.SettingOption","optionType":"DELETE","followingStateUrn":null,"modalDescription":null,"modalHeader":null,"successToastText":null},{"settingOptionDetails":null,"notificationTypeUrn":null,"edgeSettingUrn":null,"description":{"textDirection":"FIRST_STRONG","text":"Stop seeing Linda’s updates","attributesV2":[],"$recipeTypes":["com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.common.text.TextViewModelV2"],"$type":"com.linkedin.voyager.dash.common.text.TextViewModel"},"title":{"textDirection":"FIRST_STRONG","text":"Unfollow","attributesV2":[],"$recipeTypes":["com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.common.text.TextViewModelV2"],"$type":"com.linkedin.voyager.dash.common.text.TextViewModel"},"$recipeTypes":["com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.identity.notifications.FullSettingOption"],"$type":"com.linkedin.voyager.dash.identity.notifications.setting.SettingOption","optionType":"UNFOLLOW","followingStateUrn":"urn:li:fsd_followingState:urn:li:fsd_profile:ACoAAAHR7WEBx6-mRL-7AIfNrJH0rFnsLXIFZBg","modalDescription":null,"modalHeader":null,"successToastText":{"textDirection":"USER_LOCALE","text":"You will no longer receive notifications about Linda.
