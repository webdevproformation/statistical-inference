Some introductory comments
A couple of first week housekeeping items. First, make sure that you've had R Programming and the Data Scientist's Toolbox before taking this class. At a minimum you must know: very basic git and basic R.

An important aspect of this class is to peruse the materials in the github repository. All of the most up to date material can be found here

https://github.com/bcaffo/courses/tree/master/06_StatisticalInference

You should clone this repository as your first step in this class and make sure to fetch updates periodically. (Please send pull requests too!) It is one of the most essential components of the Specialization that you start to use Git frequently. We're practicing what we preach as well by using the tools in the series to create the series, especially git.

You can clone the whole repo with (http)

git clone https://github.com/bcaffo/courses.git

or (ssh)

git clone git@github.com:bcaffo/courses.git

The lectures are in the index.Rmd lecture files. In Data Products, we'll cover how to create these sorts of slides. However, for the time being, you should be able to open them in R Studio and look at their contents. You will see all of the R code to recreate the lectures. Going through the R code is the best way to familiarize yourself with the lecture materials.
