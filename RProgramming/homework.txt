Homework Problems
In the book, there are homework problems fairly similar to the quiz questions.

If you can do them, you should be in very good shape for the quizzes. The homework assignments in this course are optional. They won't count toward your final grade, but they are a good opportunity to practice the skills covered in the course. There are worked out solutions on youtube (linked to from the book).

Use arrow keys or PageUp/PageDown keys to navigate through the homework slides. These are ordered in an odd way, as the class has been restructured. So, it's probably best to just do them through the book.

Here's all four homeworks as interactive web pages (though remember, it's probably better to just keep up with them from the book):
