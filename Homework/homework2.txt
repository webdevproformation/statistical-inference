The Normal Distribution
Description
Density, distribution function, quantile function and random generation for the normal distribution with mean equal tomean and standard deviation equal to sd.
Usage
dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)
pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
Arguments
x, q
vector of quantiles.
p
vector of probabilities.
n
number of observations. If length(n) > 1, the length is taken to be the number required.
mean
vector of means.
sd
vector of standard deviations.
log, log.p
logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).
lower.tail
logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X ≤ x] otherwise, P[X > x].
Details
If mean or sd are not specified they assume the default values of 0 and 1, respectively.
The normal distribution has density
f(x) = 1/(√(2 π) σ) e^-((x - μ)^2/(2 σ^2))
where μ is the mean of the distribution and σ the standard deviation.
Value
dnorm gives the density, pnorm gives the distribution function, qnorm gives the quantile function, and rnorm generates random deviates.
The length of the result is determined by n for rnorm, and is the maximum of the lengths of the numerical arguments for the other functions.
The numerical arguments other than n are recycled to the length of the result. Only the first elements of the logical arguments are used.
For sd = 0 this gives the limit as sd decreases to 0, a point mass at mu. sd < 0 is an error and returns NaN.

For qnorm, the code is a C translation of

dnorm(0) == 1/sqrt(2*pi)

dnorm(1) == 1/sqrt(2*pi*exp(1))

## Using "log = TRUE" for an extended range :
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(function(x) dnorm(x, log = TRUE), -60, 50,
     main = "log { Normal density }")
curve(log(dnorm(x)), add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)
mtext("dnorm(x, log=TRUE)", adj = 0)
mtext("log(dnorm(x))", col = "red", adj = 1)

plot(function(x) pnorm(x, log.p = TRUE), -50, 10,
     main = "log { Normal Cumulative }")
curve(log(pnorm(x)), add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)
mtext("pnorm(x, log=TRUE)", adj = 0)
mtext("log(pnorm(x))", col = "red", adj = 1)

## if you want the so-called 'error function'
erf <- function(x) 2 * pnorm(x * sqrt(2)) - 1
## (see Abramowitz and Stegun 29.2.29)
## and the so-called 'complementary error function'
erfc <- function(x) 2 * pnorm(x * sqrt(2), lower = FALSE)
## and the inverses
erfinv <- function (x) qnorm((1 + x)/2)/sqrt(2)
erfcinv <- function (x) qnorm(x/2, lower = FALSE)/sqrt(2)


The probability that a manuscript gets accepted to a journal is 12% (say). However, given that a revision is asked for, the probability that it gets accepted is 90%. Is it possible that the probability that a manuscript has a revision asked for is 20%? 


A=accepted, B=revision. 
P(A)=.12

P(A|B)=.90. P(B)=.20

P(A∩B)=P(A|B)∗P(B)
=.9×.2=.18 this is larger than P(A)=.12, 
which is not possible since A∩B⊂A.




2. Suppose that the number of web hits to a particular site are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 100 hits per day and a standard deviation of 10 hits per day. What's the probability that a given day has fewer than 93 hits per day expressed as a percentage to the nearest percentage point?

Let X be the number of hits per day. We want P(X≤93) given that X is N(100,102).

> round(pnorm(93, mean = 100, sd = 10) * 100)

3. Suppose 5% of housing projects have issues with asbestos. The sensitivity of a test for asbestos is 93% and the specificity is 88%. What is the probability that a housing project has no asbestos given a negative test expressed as a percentage to the nearest percentage point?

A=asbestos, T+=testspositive, T−=testsnegative. 

P(A)=.05
P(T+|A)=.93 , so P(T−|A) =.07
P(T−|Ac)=.88

P(Ac|T−)=( P(T−|Ac)P(Ac) ) / ( P(T−|Ac)P(Ac)+P(T−|A)P(A) )

> (.88 * .95) / (.88 * .95 + .07 * .05)

4. Suppose that the number of web hits to a particular site are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 100 hits per day and a standard deviation of 10 hits per day.

Let x be the number of hits per day. We want x so that F(x)=0.95.

5. Suppose that the number of web hits to a particular site are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 100 hits per day and a standard deviation of 10 hits per day. 
    1. Imagine taking a random sample of 50 days. What number of web hits would be the point so that only 5% of averages of 50 days of web traffic have more hits? Express your answer to 3 decimal places. 
Let Xˉ be the average number of hits per day for 50 randomly sampled days. X is N(100,102/50).

    1. What is the change that she gets 5 or 6 right expressed as a percentage to one decimal place?
Let p=.5 and X be binomial

7. Consider a uniform distribution. If we were to sample 100 draws from a a uniform distribution (which has mean 0.5, and variance 1/12) and take their mean, Xˉ
    1. What is the approximate probability of getting as large as 0.51 or larger expressed to 3 decimal places?
Use the central limit theorem that says Xˉ∼N(μ,σ2/n)

7. If you roll ten standard dice, take their average, then repeat this process over and over and construct a histogram, 
    1. what would it be centered at?
E[Xi]=E[Xˉ] where Xˉ=1n∑ni=1Xi
The answer will be 3.5 since the mean of the sampling distribution of iid draws will be the population mean that the individual draws were taken from.
8. If you roll ten standard dice, take their average, then repeat this process over and over and construct a histogram, 
    1. what would be its variance expressed to 3 decimal places?
Var(Xˉ)=σ2/n

The answer will be 0.292 since the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean is σ2/10 where σ2 is the variance of a single die roll, which is 
> mean((1 : 6 - 3.5)^2 / 10)

9. The number of web hits to a site is Poisson with mean 16.5 per day.
